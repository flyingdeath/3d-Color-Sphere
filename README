Think of being inside 3d Color Sphere where HSV hue, saturation, and value are mapped to a Polar coordinate system pole, theta, phi.


How to Use:
click inside sphere to pick a color, shown in the 3d space as well as color swatchs patterns on the left
color shown in hex code at the top of html ui panel on the left, color swatchs below also show hex code
(#RRGGBB) red green blue in hexadecimal  
#000000 or black, #FFFFFF or white, #FF0000 or red and so on 
read more about hex code here

Select diferent polygon shapes to create different color schemas
Edit the polygon shape to change the color schema
Use mouse wheel to rotate polygons in the x y plan
to update patterns change slider or use mouse wheel 

Geometric Polygon Type Schemas (Color Theory) :
Complementary (size slider) a line 
Analogous  (size slider)    two lines joined together
Triadic (size slider)     a triangle 
Split-Complementary  (size slider)  two lines joined together forming a 'V'
Rectangle (width height slider) a rectangle
Square (width height slider) a square
Polygonal (click to create polygon shape size slider ) create a polygon of you own

Value Gradient (value slider)
Random swatch generator (value slider) / Random Value
5 swatch Color Patterns 

Using  HTML, CSS and Javascript, YUI, Three JS, WebGL.

For WebGL to work you need a applicable video card/chip.
Nvidia and ATI Both make video card/chip that support WebGL.
