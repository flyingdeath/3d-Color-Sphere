Think of being inside 3d Color Sphere where HSV are mapped to a Polar coordinate system pole theta phi.

Geometric Polygon Type Schemas (Color Theory) :
click inside sphere to get color swatchs
color show in hex code
to update pattern change slider or use mouse wheel 

Use mouse wheel to rotate polygons in the x y plan

Select diferent polygon shapes to create different color schemas
Edit the polygon shape to change the color schema

Complementary (size slider) a line 
Analogous  (size slider)    two lines joined together
Triadic (size slider)     a triangle 
Split-Complementary  (size slider)  two lines joined together forming a 'V'
Rectangle (width height slider) a rectangle
Square (width height slider) a square
Polygonal (click to create polygon size slider ) create a polygon of you own

Value Gradient (value slider)
Random swatch generator (value slider) / Random Value
5 swatch Color Patterns 

Using  HTML, CSS and Javascript, YUI, Three JS, WebGL.

For WebGL to work you need a applicable video card/chip.
Nvidia and ATI Both make video card/chip that support WebGL.

Test for WebGL here https://get.webgl.org/
